\chapter{Building GMAC\slash Lite Applications}

This chapter discusses how to use the OpenCL extensions provided by GMAC\slash Lite. The programming 
of multi\hyp{}threaded and complex applications in GMAC\slash Lite does only differ from OpenCL in 
the way data structures are allocated and passed to kernels. Hence, we only discuss these two topics 
in the context of the single\hyp{}threaded implementation of the same vector addition example used 
in Chapter~\ref{chapter:hpe}.
