\section{The GMAC CPU Threading Model}

GMAC offers two different flavors for integrating GPUs in the application execution. The first 
model, \emph{HPE}, is a high\hyp{}level CPU threading model that hides most of the complexities of 
handling with GPUs in both single\hyp{}threaded and multi\hyp{}threaded applications running on top 
of single\hyp{}GPU and multi\hyp{}GPU systems. The second model, \emph{Lite}, is an OpenCL\hyp{}like 
interface which fully exposes the OpenCL run\hyp{}time system to application programmers.
