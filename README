GMAC 11.10 Release Notes (10/31/2011)

New Features
------------
 - Support for pointer arithmetic on OpenCL kernel arguments
 - Support for Mac OS X Lion
 - Added eclCompileBinary() and "eclCompileBinaryFile()" to compile OpenCL binary kernels
 - Added eclGetAcceleratorInfo() to get information about the device being used
 - Added eclGetFreeMemory() to get the amount of free memory on the device
 - Added C++11 interface for OpenCL kernel calls


Bug Fixes
---------

 - Modified eclFree() and clFree() to accept NULL pointers
 - Modified eclCompileSourceFile() to return error code when the source file is not found
 - CL/Helpers moved to external library to avoid incorrect destruction order
 - Fixed table symbol patching on Windows which caused GMAC/CL on Windows to dead-lock
 - Fixed native thread identification on Windows which caused occasional application crashes at exit time
 - Fixed bad TLS allocation which produced occasional errors on multi-threaded applications
 - Fixed usage of assert() on sample files which prevented samples running when compiled on Release mode
 - Fixed memory leak which prevented shared allocations used by several threads to be correctly released

Known Issues
------------

 - Only one GMAC version (32-bit or 64-bit) can be installed
 - On Windows, GMAC/CL 32-bit causes a deadlock in the AMD OpenCL driver when running on 64-bit machines
 - On Windows, if the samples are compiled, the user needs to remove by hand the GMAC directory before reinstalling
